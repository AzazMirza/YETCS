          <div class="mb-8 overflow-hidden">
            <img loading="lazy" src="images/hidden-mold.webp" height="auto" width="100%" style="aspect-ratio: 21/9; object-fit: cover;" alt="damaged-front-door-due-to-mold-and-asbestos" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-md">
          </div>
          <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed kk wm">Let’s be real — life in Brooklyn moves fast. Between work, family, and trying to keep up with the latest neighborhood pop-up café, finding time to deep clean your home can feel like a luxury you don’t have. But here’s what many people overlook: a messy home isn’t just about appearances—it can actually affect your health. And we don’t mean feeling a little tired—we’re talking about serious, unseen threats like mold, dust mites, bacteria, and allergens hiding in places you rarely check—under the sink, behind the fridge, or floating in the air you breathe every single day.</p>

          <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed kk wm">At <a class="text-blue-700 hover:underline" href="{{route('index')}}">YETCS Environmental</a>, we’ve worked in homes throughout Brooklyn—from historic brownstones in Fort Greene to cozy apartments in Sunset Park—and we’ve seen firsthand how dust, mold, bacteria, and allergens can quietly build up, often without the homeowner even noticing. That’s why we believe cleaning goes far beyond appearances—it’s about protecting your health, your loved ones, and the safety of your home.</p>

          <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed kk wm">Let’s take a closer look at some of the most common hidden dangers that might be right under your nose—and what you can do to address them before they become a real problem.</p>

          <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">1. Mold & Mildew – The Silent Roommates:</h3>
          <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
            <img loading="lazy" src="images/mildew-bedroom.webp" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Multiple-kinds-of-mold-on-a-wall" class="w-full md:h-[400px] h-[250px] rounded object-cover mb-4">
            <p class="wm kk">Mold tends to grow in hidden, moisture-prone spots—like behind bathroom tiles, under sinks, inside kitchen cabinets, or in the shadowy corners of a damp basement where humidity sticks around. And during those hot, humid Brooklyn summers—or after something as simple as a leaky pipe—mold can start growing before you even know it’s there.</p>
            <p class="wm kk">Why is this a problem? Mold releases microscopic spores into the air, which can trigger allergies, cause persistent coughing, and worsen asthma—especially in children, seniors, or anyone with respiratory issues.</p>
            <p class="wm kk"><strong> Tip:</strong> If you catch a musty smell or see spots of discoloration on your walls or ceilings, don’t ignore it. That’s a red flag. We recommend a professional deep clean at least twice a year—especially if your home has had past water damage or moisture problems.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">2. Bacteria in the Kitchen – More Than Just Sticky Handles:</h3>
          <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
            <img loading="lazy" src="images/sink-cleaning.webp" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Lead-paint-old-image" class="w-full md:h-[400px] h-[150px] object-cover mb-4 object-bottom rounded">
            <p class="wm kk">We all know the kitchen is one of the busiest spots in any home—between meal prep, cooking mishaps, coffee spills, and midnight snacks, it sees a lot of action every day. But did you know that your cutting board, sink drain, or fridge seal could be harboring harmful bacteria like E. coli or Salmonella?</p>
            <p class="wm kk">These invisible invaders can trigger everything from foodborne illness to lingering stomach issues—and they love to hide out in those overlooked spots that don’t usually get the thorough cleaning they deserve.</p>
            <p class="wm kk"><strong> Tip:</strong> Try to give your kitchen a deep clean once a week. Focus on high-touch areas like appliance handles, cabinet knobs, backsplashes, and light switches—those often-overlooked spots can be magnets for germs and bacteria. A little extra attention here can make a big difference in keeping your home healthier.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">3. Dust Mites – Tiny Troublemakers in Your Textiles:</h3>
          <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
            <img loading="lazy" src="images/cleaning-carpet.webp" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Asbestos image" class="w-full md:h-[400px] h-[250px] rounded object-cover mb-4">
            <p class="wm kk">Dust mites are microscopic pests that live in bedding, curtains, rugs, and couches — basically anywhere cozy and soft. They thrive on dead skin cells (yes, it’s true) and leave behind waste particles that can trigger allergies, asthma, and other respiratory issues.</p>
            <p class="wm kk">In Brooklyn’s older buildings—particularly those with carpets, upholstered furniture, or thick drapes—dust mites can quickly become a problem if not kept in check with regular deep cleaning.</p>
            <p class="wm kk"><strong> Tip:</strong> Vacuum frequently using a HEPA filter vacuum to trap dust and allergens, wash bedding in hot water weekly, and schedule professional upholstery and carpet cleaning every few months to keep your indoor air fresh and healthy.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">4. Pet Dander: The Invisible Guest in Your Home:</h3>
          <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
            <p class="wm kk">Brooklyn loves its pets—and we do too! But if you or someone in your home has allergies, pet dander (tiny flecks of skin) can stick around for months, clinging to furniture, floors, and even air vents.</p>
            <p class="wm kk">It’s invisible, hard to remove with regular cleaning, and can cause sneezing, congestion, and irritated eyes.</p>
            <p class="wm kk"><strong> Tip:</strong> Deep cleaning after shedding season or before a guest visit helps reduce allergens and keeps your space feeling fresh.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">5. Clutter & Grime – Impacting Mental Health More Than You Think:</h3>
          <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
            <p class="wm kk">Did you know that a cluttered or consistently unclean space can do more than just make your to-do list feel endless? It can actually raise stress levels, heighten anxiety, and even disrupt your ability to get restful sleep—impacting both your mood and your overall well-being. For busy Brooklynites juggling jobs, kids, or roommates, a clean space can be a true refuge.</p>
            <p class="wm kk"><strong> Tip:</strong> Sometimes, all it takes is one deep clean to reset your mindset and give you that “fresh start” feeling again.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">6. Germs in Shared Spaces – Spreading Faster Than You Think:</h3>
          <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
            <p class="wm kk">If you live in a multi-family building, rental unit, or shared apartment, high-touch surfaces like door handles, railings, elevator buttons, and light switches become germ highways. Without regular disinfecting, viruses can spread quickly. This is especially important during cold and flu season — or when preparing for a new tenant move-in.</p>
            <p class="wm kk"><strong> Tip:</strong> Consider scheduling a post-season or turnover deep clean to protect everyone who lives in or visits your property.</p>
          </div>
