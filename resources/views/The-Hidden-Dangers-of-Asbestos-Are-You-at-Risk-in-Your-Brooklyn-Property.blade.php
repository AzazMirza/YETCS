            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed kk wm">If you’re a homeowner, landlord, or renter in Brooklyn, there’s a real possibility your property could be hiding something you can’t see—but that could seriously impact your health. Hazards like asbestos, lead paint, or hidden mold are common in older buildings and can pose serious risks if left unchecked.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed kk wm">At <a class="text-blue-700 hover:underline" href="{{route('index')}}">YETCS Environmental</a>, we specialize in identifying and addressing environmental risks in residential properties across Brooklyn — from Park Slope to Greenpoint, and everywhere in between. While we don’t perform asbestos removal ourselves, we’re big believers in awareness and prevention. Because with asbestos, what you don’t know can hurt you—and knowledge truly is power.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed kk wm">We’ll explore what asbestos is, where it could be hiding in your home, and the steps you can take to keep your household and visitors safe. When it comes to asbestos, being informed is your best protection.</p>

            <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">What Is Asbestos?</h3>
            <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
              <img loading="lazy" src="images/brooklyn-asbestos.webp" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Asbestos material close-up" class="w-full md:h-[400px] h-[250px] rounded object-cover mb-4">
              <p class="wm kk">Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was heavily used in construction due to its strength, heat resistance, and insulating properties. Before regulations changed in the 1980s, it was commonly found in materials like insulation, floor and ceiling tiles, roofing products, and other building components—often hidden from plain sight.</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 wm kk space-y-2">
                <li>Insulation (especially around pipes and boilers)</li>
                <li>Floor tiles and the adhesive beneath them</li>
                <li>Ceiling textures (like “popcorn ceilings”)</li>
                <li>Roofing and siding materials</li>
                <li>HVAC duct insulation</li>
                <li>Older window glazing or caulking</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="wm kk">While modern building codes have largely phased out asbestos use, many older Brooklyn buildings still contain these materials — especially in neighborhoods like Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, and Fort Greene, where pre-war architecture is abundant.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">Why Is Asbestos Dangerous?</h3>
            <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
              <img loading="lazy" src="images/brooklyn-building.webp" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Lung damage from asbestos exposure" class="w-full md:h-[400px] h-[250px] rounded object-cover mb-4">
              <p class="wm kk">Here’s the thing: asbestos isn’t hazardous just because it’s present—it becomes dangerous when it’s disturbed. When materials with asbestos are cut, broken, or mishandled, they can release tiny fibers into the air—so small you won’t see them or even know they’re there. But once you breathe them in, those fibers can settle deep in your lungs and quietly cause serious health problems over the years.</p>
              <p class="wm kk">Breathing in these fibers over time can lead to serious long-term health problems, including:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 wm kk space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Asbestosis</strong> – A chronic lung condition caused by asbestos fibers, leading to scarring and long-term breathing difficulties.</li>
                <li><strong>Lung Cancer</strong> – Risk significantly increases with asbestos exposure, particularly among smokers.</li>
                <li><strong>Mesothelioma</strong> – A rare, aggressive cancer that develops in the lining of the lungs or abdomen, almost always linked to asbestos exposure.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="wm kk">These health issues often don’t show up until decades after exposure, which is why many people don’t realize the harm until it’s far too late. That’s exactly why early awareness and taking preventative steps are so important—it’s the best way to protect yourself before the damage is done.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">Who Is at Risk in Brooklyn?</h3>
            <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
              <p class="wm kk">Many homes built prior to 1980 likely contain asbestos in building materials, so it’s important to have a certified inspection done before beginning any repairs or remodeling. That means:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 wm kk space-y-2">
                <li>Homeowners renovating older kitchens or bathrooms</li>
                <li>Landlords preparing units for new tenants</li>
                <li>Contractors doing demolition or remodeling work</li>
                <li>Families living in homes with deteriorating materials</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="wm kk">Even small DIY jobs — like removing old flooring or patching a ceiling — can release harmful fibers if proper precautions aren’t taken.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">How Do You Know If You Have Asbestos?</h3>
            <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
              <p class="wm kk">You can’t tell if a material contains asbestos just by looking at it. The only way to know for sure is through professional testing by a licensed inspector.</p>
              <p class="wm kk">If you suspect your property may contain asbestos, especially during a renovation or cleanup project, do not disturb the material. Rather than taking chances, it’s best to consult a certified asbestos inspection service for peace of mind. They can safely test your property, identify any hazards, and guide you through the proper next steps based on your specific situation.</p>
              <p class="wm kk">We always recommend getting a professional assessment before starting any major cleaning or renovation job — especially in older Brooklyn properties.</p>

            <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">How to Stay Safe</h3>
            <div :class="{'bg-green-50': !darkMode, 'bg-green-600': darkMode}" class="p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4 mb-8">
              <p class="wm kk">Here are our top tips for protecting yourself and your family from asbestos exposure:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 wm kk space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Treat unknown materials as potentially asbestos-containing</strong> — especially in homes built before the 1980s.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid disturbing anything you suspect may contain asbestos</strong> — avoid sanding, scraping, or drilling until inspected.</li>
                <li><strong>Hire a licensed asbestos inspector</strong> if you plan to renovate.</li>
                <li><strong>Work with certified professionals</strong> for any removal or abatement.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep materials intact and undisturbed</strong> if removal isn't necessary.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h3 class="kk wm text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-green-400">Why This Matters for Brooklyn</h3>
